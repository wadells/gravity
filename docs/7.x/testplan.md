apiVersion: cluster.gravitational.io/v2
kind: Cluster
metadata:
    name: test
    resourceVersion: 1.0.0
```

- [ ] Verify `tele` selects base image matching its own version:
```bash
$ tele build app.yaml
```

- [ ] Pick base image version from the hub compatible with `tele` (same major/minor version components):
```bash
$ tele ls --all
```

- [ ] Pin base image in the manifest to the selected version:
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.gravitational.io/v2
kind: Cluster
baseImage: gravity:6.0.0
metadata:
    name: test
    resourceVersion: 1.0.0
```

  - [ ] Verify can build the installer.
```bash
$ tele build app.yaml
```

$ tele login --hub example.gravitational.io
```

- [ ] Unpin runtime from manifest and run `tele build`.
  - [ ] Verify `tele` selects base image matching its own version.

### Application Catalog

This section covers the application catalog features. It requires a Hub.

#### Building & Publishing

- [ ] Build application images from the sample Helm charts in `assets/charts`.
```bash
$ tele build assets/charts/alpine-0.1.0
$ tele build assets/charts/alpine-0.2.0
```

- [ ] Log into the Hub.
```bash
$ tele login --hub example.gravitational.io:32009
```

- [ ] Push the built application image into the Hub.
```bash
$ tele push alpine-0.1.0.tar
```

- [ ] Make sure the application is shown in the image list.
```bash
$ tele ls
```

- [ ] Verify the application image tarball can be downloaded from the Hub.
```bash
$ tele pull alpine:0.1.0
```

- [ ] Verify Helm chart can be searched for and downloaded from the Hub.
```bash
$ helm search alpine
$ helm fetch example.gravitational.io/alpine --version 0.1.0
```

- [ ] Verify one of the application's Docker images can be pulled from the Hub.
```bash
$ docker pull example.gravitational.io:32009/alpine:3.3
```

#### Discovery

- [ ] Install a cluster.

- [ ] Connect the cluster to a Hub using [Trusted Cluster](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/config/#trusted-clusters-enterprise) resource.

- [ ] Verify the application can be searched for in the connected Hub.
```bash
$ gravity app search --all
$ gravity app search alpine --all
```

#### Lifecycle

- [ ] Transfer both built application images (`alpine-0.1.0.tar`, `alpine-0.2.0.tar`) onto the cluster node.

- [ ] Install the application.
```bash
$ gravity app install alpine-0.1.0.tar
```

- [ ] Verify an application instance has been deployed.
```bash
$ gravity app ls
$ kubectl get pods
```

- [ ] Install the application directly from the Hub.
```bash
$ gravity app install <hub-name>/alpine:0.1.0
```

- [ ] Verify there are now 2 instances of the application running.
```bash
$ gravity app ls
$ kubectl get pods
```

- [ ] Upgrade one of the deployed application.
```bash
$ gravity app upgrade <release-name> alpine-0.2.0.tar
```

- [ ] Verify the application has been upgraded.
```bash
$ gravity app ls
```

- [ ] Rollback the upgraded application.
```bash
$ gravity app rollback <release-name> 1
```

- [ ] Verify the application has been rolled back.
```bash
$ gravity app ls
```

### Licensing & Encryption [Enterprise Edition]

This scenario builds an encrypted installer for a cluster image that requires
a license and makes sure that it can be installed with valid license. It is
only supported in the enterprise edition.

```bash
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt
```

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.gravitational.io/v2
kind: Cluster
metadata:
    name: test
    resourceVersion: 1.0.0
license:
    enabled: true
```

- [ ] Generate a license with encryption key:
```bash
$ gravity license new --max-nodes=3 --valid-for=24h --ca-cert=domain.crt --ca-key=domain.key --encryption-key=qwe123 > license.pem
```

```

### Runtime Environment Update

This scenario updates the runtime environment of the planet container with new environment variables.

Prerequisites: multi-node cluster with at least 1 node `--role=knode` and 1 `--role=node|master`.
Having both `knode` and `node|master` is necessary to test both master and regular node update paths.

[environ.yaml]
```yaml
kind: RuntimeEnvironment
version: v1
spec:
  data:
    "FOO": "qux"
    "BAR": "foobar"
```

```bash
root$ gravity resource create environ.yaml --confirm
```

- [ ] Verify the operation completes successfully.
  - [ ] Verify the environment inside the container has been updated on each node (the environment variables have been added to the /etc/container-environment).
  - [ ] Verify that services have the environment applied. Choose `dockerd` process for verification and check that `/proc/$(pidof dockerd)/environ` contains the configured environment variables.

### Cluster Configuration Update

This scenario updates the cluster configuration.

Prerequisites: multi-node cluster with at least 1 node `--role=knode` and 1 `--role=node|master`.

[config.yaml]
```yaml
kind: ClusterConfiguration
version: v1
spec:
  kubelet:
    config:
      kind: KubeletConfiguration
      apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
      # Update kubelet configuration
      nodeLeaseDurationSeconds: 50
      # Cannot update certain fields
      healthzBindAddress: "127.0.0.2"
      healthzPort: 11248
  global:
    featureGates:
      AllAlpha: true
      APIResponseCompression: false
      BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume: false
      # Update feature gates
      ExperimentalHostUserNamespaceDefaulting: true
```

```bash
root$ gravity resource create config.yaml --confirm
```

- [ ] Verify the operation completes successfully.
  - [ ] Verify the feature gates parameter of all kubernetes components has been updated to the configured set (`KUBE_COMPONENT_FLAGS` in /etc/container-environment inside the container).
  - [ ] Verify kubelet configuration (`/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.yaml`) reflects the configuration (`nodeLeaseDurationSeconds` is set to `50`)
  - [ ] Verify kubelet configuration has not been changed for fields `healthzBindAddress` (should still be "0.0.0.0") and `healthzPort` (should still be `10248`)

[cloud-config.yaml]
```yaml
kind: ClusterConfiguration
version: v1
spec:
  global:
    cloudConfig: |
      [global]
      # Update node tags
      # Should only work if installed with a cloud-provider
      node-tags=test-cluster
```

Now, create the operation in manual mode:

```bash
root$ gravity resource create cloud-config.yaml --confirm -m
```

- [ ] Verify that the operation plan only contains update steps for master nodes as only cloud configuration is being updated.
- [ ] Verify can complete the operation successfully with `gravity plan resume`.
  - [ ] Verify cloud configuration file has been written in `/etc/kubernetes/cloud-config.conf` with the following contents:
  ```
  [global]
  node-tags=test-cluster
  ```

### Collecting Garbage

This scenario tests garbage collection on a cluster.

Prerequisites: multi-node cluster with at least 1 node `--role=knode` and 1 `--role=node|master`.
Having both `knode` and `node|master` is necessary to test both master and regular node update paths.
