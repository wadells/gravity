# Introduction

This is an example online shopping app utilizing microservices in K8s with minor modifications from https://github.com/instana/robot-shop.  The modifications were to set registry helm variables and storage.  Note this image by default uses OpenEBS from Gravity 7.0+.  On deployment you will get this front page:

## Before You Begin

Check your system requirements and download the `tele` binary following the [Gravity Quickstart](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/quickstart/).

## Building Cluster Image

To construct a dependency-free .tar file containing the Robot Shop Cluster Image use the following `tele` command:

```bash
tele build -o robotshop.tar robot-shop-app/resources/app.yaml
```

You can then deploy the Robot Shop as a self-contained, truly portable application for your preferred infrastructure.
Further details on installing Gravity Cluster Images is available [here](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/installation/).


## Building Application

In addition to Cluster Images, Gravity supports packaging application helm charts as self-contained application images. The application is then deployable in the same manner as helm charts to Gravity clusters. Further information on application packaging deployment is available [here](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/catalog/).

```bash
tele build -o robotshop.tar robot-shop-app/resources/charts/robot-shop
```

The Robot Shop web application runs in this configuration on a nodeport of 30085.

## Installing
After deploying you should see the following available deployments:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments

# Load generation
Instana's github [repository](https://github.com/instana/robot-shop) contains load generation scripts. Pull down this repository if you'd like to execute load examples. After the application has deployed, change the load-gen/load-gen.sh file's HOST variable to the application deployment  (http://<my ip>:30085).
Switch to the load-gen directory and run `load-gen.sh -n 20` to generate load from 20 clients.  Please explore the load script for other options.
